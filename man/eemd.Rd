\usage{
eemd(input, num_imfs = 0, ensemble_size = 250L, noise_strength = 0.2,
  S_number = 4L, num_siftings = 50L, rng_seed = 0L, threads = 0L)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Vector of length N. The input signal to decompose.}

\item{num_imfs}{Number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) to compute. If num_imfs is set to zero,
a value of num_imfs = emd_num_imfs(N) will be used, which corresponds to a maximal number of
IMFs. Note that the final residual is also counted as an IMF in this respect, so you most
likely want at least num_imfs=2.}

\item{ensemble_size}{Number of copies of the input signal to use as the ensemble.}

\item{noise_strength}{Standard deviation of the Gaussian random numbers used as additional noise.
\bold{This value is relative} to the standard deviation of the input signal.}

\item{S_number}{Integer. Use the S-number stopping criterion for the EMD procedure with the given
values of $S$. That is, iterate until the number of extrema and zero crossings in the signal
differ at most by one, and stay the same for S consecutive iterations. Typical values are in
the range 3--8. If \code{S_number} is zero, this stopping criterion is ignored. Default is 4.}

\item{num_siftings}{Use a maximum number of siftings as a stopping criterion. If
\code{num_siftings} is zero, this stopping criterion is ignored. Default is 50.}

\item{rng_seed}{A seed for the GSL's Mersenne twister random number generator. A value of zero
(default) denotes an implementation-defined default value.}

\item{threads}{Non-negative integer defining the maximum number of parallel threads (via OpenMP's
\code{omp_set_num_threads}. Default value 0 uses all available threads defined by OpenMP's
\code{omp_get_max_threads}.}
}
\value{
Time series object of class \code{"mts"} where series corresponds to IMFs of the input
  signal, with the last series being the final residual.
}
\description{
Decompose input data to Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) with the Ensemble Empirical Mode
Decomposition algorithm [1].
}
\details{
The size of the ensemble and the relative magnitude of the added noise are given by parameters
\code{ensemble_size} and \code{noise_strength}, respectively.  The stopping criterion for the
decomposition is given by either a S-number [2] or an absolute number of siftings. In the case
that both are positive numbers, the sifting ends when either of the conditions is fulfilled.

\examples{
x <- seq(0, 2*pi, length.out=500)
signal <- sin(4*x)
intermittent <- 0.1*sin(80*x)
y <- signal * (1 + ifelse(signal > 0.7, intermittent,0))

plot(x=x,y=y,type="l")
# Decompose with EEMD
imfs <- eemd(y, num_siftings = 10, ensemble_size = 50, threads = 1)

plot(imfs)
# High frequencies
ts.plot(rowSums(imfs[,1:3]))
# Low frequencies
ts.plot(rowSums(imfs[,4:ncol(imfs)]))
