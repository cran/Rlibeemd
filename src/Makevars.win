# Per CRAN policies it is not portable to use both SHLIB_OPENMP_CFLAGS and SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS.
# Therefore the CRAN version does not use OpenMP at all anymore, but the github version does.
# Please file an issue if you encounter portability issues (so far none found).

## This assumes that the LIB_GSL variable points to working GSL libraries
